  This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
  
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Let's look at data summary
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```


### Graph
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
attach(cars)
plot(dist, speed)
abline(lm(speed~dist))
title("Relationship between Speed & Distance")
```
